# Shorting high FDV, low float tokens :)

## The basics

_What does FDV mean?_

FDV, or Fully Diluted Valuation refers to the total marketcap of a token assuming all tokens are in circulation.
It can be calculated using the token price multiplied by the total supply of the token.
A longer explanation can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-fully-diluted-valuation-fdv-in-crypto).

_What does low float mean?_

A _low float_ token, is a token that has a small circulating supply, relative to its final circulating supply.

## The thesis
Low float tokens that have a high FDV are likely priced high relative to their "true" value and their prices should drop as the circulating supply increases. The ideal token to short is a high FDV token with a known unlock schedule while also being relatively cheap to maintain a short position in.

## The risks

### Reduction of future supply.

Tokens can be burned / rendered inaccessible and thus effectively reducing the FDV of a token. One example is when the founder of the Jupiter aggregator on Solana [proposed a 30% burn](https://x.com/weremeow/status/1803453096661590363) of total supply, resulting in an almost 10% spike in the price of JUP, with action absent in any of the other major tokens.

## Some historical examples

### LDO

Lido is a governance token for a [LST](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-liquid-staking-liquid-staked-derivatives-you-need-to-know) protocol. Not just "a" protocol but *the* protocol, being the largest liquid staking protocol for ethereum.

Yet despite circulating marketcap increasing by over 10x from 2022 to 2024, price has remained stagnant. That being said, price hasn't really decreased so you probably wouldn't have made a profit shorting unless you had a good entry.

Here are your LDO charts:

That being said, what if you hedged your short LDO position with a long ETH position? This looks quite promising :)

Now as an exercise to the reader:
- Is long ETH a good hedge for short LDO? Why or why not?
